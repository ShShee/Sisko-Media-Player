# About playing music

Oviously, it can play music and movies but its limit is only about for files with extension mp3 or mp4.

Users enjoy their playlist with a bunch of songs instead of just ordinarily listening to one song. Besides that,
they can modify their playlist by adding or removing  many songs to it. 

Furthermore, Sisko also assists users with modes such as:

+ Forward: play next song of now playing in playlist.

+ Backward: play previous song of now playing in playlist.

+ Stop: to halt completely now playing song 

+ Repeat: auto repeating playlist while last song ended.

+ Random: randomly play songs in playlist without following any order.

+ Change Volume: volume interior Sisko can be raised or lowered or even mute

+ Quick Play: to hear a specified song - double click at it or  choose it  and press right click choose play then Sisko will play your choice instantly.

+ Play Next: to set a song that will be played after now playing - choose it and press right click choose play next.

+ Jump: to skip time by click trackbar (only 5s each leap) or scroll trackbar
