# About playing music

Users enjoy their playlist with a bunch of songs instead of just ordinarily listening to one song. Besides that,
they can modify their playlist by adding or removing  many songs to it. 

Furthermore, Sisko also assists users with modes such as:

+ Forward: play next song of now playing in playlist.
